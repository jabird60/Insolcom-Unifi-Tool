# Discovery Enhancements - Adoption Status & Auto Site Selection

## Overview

The network discovery process has been significantly enhanced to provide better visibility into device adoption status and automatically manage site selection for adopted devices.

## New Features

### 1. Enhanced Discovery Table

**New Columns:**
- **Name**: Device name/alias/hostname
- **Adopted**: Shows adoption status with visual indicators
- **Site**: Displays which site adopted devices belong to
- **MAC**: Device MAC address (moved to last column)

**Visual Indicators:**
- **✓ Yes** (Green) - Device is adopted
- **✗ No** (Red) - Device is not adopted
- **Site names** are color-coded (Blue for adopted, Gray for unadopted)

### 2. Automatic Site Selection

When adopted devices are discovered:
- **Auto-detects** which site the devices belong to
- **Automatically selects** the most common site
- **Updates** the site dropdown to match
- **Synchronizes** all views (Devices, WiFi) with the selected site

### 3. Multi-Site Discovery

The discovery process now:
- **Checks all sites** in the controller, not just the current one
- **Maps devices** to their correct sites
- **Shows accurate** adoption status regardless of current site selection

## How It Works

### Discovery Process

1. **Network Scan**: Discovers devices on the local network
2. **Controller Check**: Queries all sites for device information
3. **Status Mapping**: Maps discovered IPs to controller devices
4. **Visual Update**: Updates table with adoption status and site info
5. **Auto-Selection**: Automatically selects the site with the most adopted devices

### Visual Feedback

```
IP              Name            Ping  SSH 22  Adopted  Site              MAC
192.168.1.100  AP-Lobby        yes   open   ✓ Yes    Main Office       aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
192.168.1.101  (Unknown)       yes   open   ✗ No                      bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:aa
192.168.1.102  AP-Conference   yes   open   ✓ Yes    Main Office       cc:dd:ee:ff:aa:bb
```

### Color Coding

- **Adopted Status**:
  - Green background + text for adopted devices
  - Red background + text for unadopted devices

- **Device Names**:
  - Blue background + text for adopted device names
  - Dark gray text for unadopted device names

- **Site Information**:
  - Blue background + text for adopted device sites
  - Gray background + text for unadopted devices

## Benefits

### For Network Setup

1. **Immediate Visibility**: Instantly see which devices are already adopted
2. **Site Management**: Automatically work with the correct site
3. **Efficient Workflow**: No need to manually select sites for adopted devices
4. **Error Prevention**: Avoid working with wrong sites

### For Troubleshooting

1. **Status Overview**: Quick assessment of device adoption status
2. **Site Identification**: Know which site devices belong to
3. **Mixed Environments**: Handle devices from multiple sites
4. **Visual Clarity**: Easy to distinguish adopted vs unadopted devices

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: New Network Setup
1. Run discovery on a new network
2. See all devices show as "✗ No" (unadopted)
3. Select devices and proceed with adoption
4. Site selection remains on your chosen site

### Scenario 2: Existing Network
1. Run discovery on an existing network
2. See some devices show as "✓ Yes" (adopted)
3. System automatically selects the site with adopted devices
4. You can immediately work with the existing devices

### Scenario 3: Mixed Environment
1. Run discovery on a network with devices from multiple sites
2. See devices from different sites
3. System selects the site with the most devices
4. You can manually change sites if needed

## Technical Implementation

### Database Queries
- Queries all sites for device information
- Maps devices by IP address
- Tracks site membership for each device

### UI Updates
- Real-time table updates with visual indicators
- Automatic site selection logic
- Progress logging for user feedback

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if site queries fail
- Continues operation even with partial data
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Configuration

### Table Layout
- **Column 0**: IP Address (120px)
- **Column 1**: Device Name (150px)
- **Column 2**: Ping Status (60px)
- **Column 3**: SSH Status (80px)
- **Column 4**: Adoption Status (80px)
- **Column 5**: Site Name (150px)
- **Column 6**: MAC Address (140px)

### Auto-Selection Logic
- Counts devices per site
- Selects site with highest device count
- Updates all related views automatically
- Provides user feedback via progress log

## Troubleshooting

### No Adoption Status Shown
- Check controller connectivity
- Verify site permissions
- Ensure devices are actually adopted

### Wrong Site Selected
- Manually change site in dropdown
- System will update all views
- Re-run discovery if needed

### Missing Site Information
- Check if sites exist in controller
- Verify site names and keys
- Check controller permissions

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- **Device Type Detection**: Show device model/type
- **Firmware Version**: Display current firmware
- **Last Seen**: Show when device was last online
- **Bulk Operations**: Select all adopted/unadopted devices
- **Export Functionality**: Export discovery results

## Compatibility

- **UniFi Controllers**: All versions supported
- **Device Types**: All UniFi devices (APs, switches, etc.)
- **Network Types**: Works with any network configuration
- **Multi-Site**: Fully supports multi-site deployments
